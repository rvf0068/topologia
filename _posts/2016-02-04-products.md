# Product topology

## A base for a topology

1.  Base of the product topology

    Let $$X$$ and $$Y$$ be topological spaces. Let $$\mathcal{B}$$ be
    the collection of all subsets of $$X\times Y$$ of the form
    $$U\times V$$, where $$U$$ is open in $$X$$ and $$V$$ is open in
    $$Y$$. Then $$\mathcal{B}$$ is a base for a topology on $$X\times
        Y$$.

2.  Proof
    -   For any $$(x,y)\in X\times Y$$, considering that $$X\times Y\in
              \mathcal{B}$$, we have that (B1) is satisfied.
    -   Property $$(B2)$$ follows from the fact that in general:
        
        $$
        (A\times B)\cap (C\times D) = (A\cap C)\times (B\cap D). \qquad \Box
        $$

## Product topology

1.  Product topology

    The topology $$\tau_{\mathcal{B}}$$ is called the **product
    topology** on the Cartesian product $$X\times Y$$.

## Product by a base

1.  Product topology given by a base

    Let $$X$$ be space with base $$\mathcal{B}$$, and
    $$Y$$ be a space with base $$\mathcal{C}$$. Then
    
    $$
    \mathcal{D}=\{B\times C\mid B\in \mathcal{B}, C\in \mathcal{C}\}
    $$
    
    is a base for the product topology on $$X\times Y$$.

2.  Proof
    -   Let $$W$$ be an open set in the product topology, and $$(x,y)\in
              W$$.
    -   By definition of base of the product topology, there are open
        sets $$U$$ in $$X$$ and $$V$$ in $$Y$$ with $$(x,y)\in U\times
              V\subseteq W$$.
    -   Again by definition of base, there are $$B\in \mathcal{B}$$,
        $$C\in \mathcal{C}$$ with $$x\in B\subseteq U$$, $$y\in
              C\subseteq V$$. We have then $$B\times C\in \mathcal{D}$$, and
        
        $$
        (x,y)\in B\times C\subseteq W.\qquad \Box
        $$

## Examples

1.  Product topology on $$\mathbb{R}^2$$

    A base for the product of two standard topologies on
    $$\mathbb{R}$$ is the collection of all rectangles of the form
    $$(a,b)\times (c,d)$$. It follows that the product topology is the
    same as the metric topology on $$\mathbb{R}$$.

2.  Product of Sierpiński spaces

    Describe the points and the open sets on the product $$X\times
        X$$, when $$X$$ is a Sierpiński space.

## Projections

1.  Projections

    The maps $$\pi_{1}\colon X\times Y\to X$$ and $$\pi_{2}\colon
        X\times Y\to Y$$ are called **projections** of $$X\times Y$$.

2.  Inverse images of projections

    If $$U$$ is open in $$X$$, then $$\pi_1^{-1}(U)=$$
    
    $$U\times Y$$, which
    is open in $$X\times Y$$. Similarly, if $$V$$ is open in $$Y$$,
    the set $$\pi_2^{-1}(V)=X\times V$$, is open in $$X\times Y$$.
    
    We have
    
    $$ \pi_1^{-1}(U)\cap \pi_2^{-1}(V) = U\times V $$

## Subbase of the product

1.  Subbase

    The collection
    $$\mathcal{S}=\{\pi_1^{-1}(U)\}_{U\in\tau_{X}}\cup\{\pi_2^{-1}(V)\}_{V\in\tau_Y}$$
    is a subbase for the product topology on $$X\times Y$$.

## Subspace and products

1.  Subspace and product topology

    Let $$A,B$$ be subspaces of $$X,Y$$ respectively. Then the product
    topology on $$A\times B$$ is the same as the topology on $$A\times
        B$$ as subspace of the product space $$X\times Y$$.

2.  Proof

    Exercise



## Exercises

1.  A map $$f\colon X\to Y$$ between topological space is said to be
    **open** if $$f(U)$$ is open for every $$U\subseteq X$$ which is
    an open set. Prove that the projection $$\pi_{X}\colon X\times
          Y\to X$$ is an open set.
2.  Let $$I$$ denote the closed interval $$[0,1]\subseteq
          \mathbb{R}$$ as a subspace of the usual topology on
    $$\mathbb{R}$$. Compare the product topology on $$I\times I$$,
    the dictionary order topology on $$I\times I$$, and the product
    $$I_{d}\times I$$, where $$I_{d}$$ denotes discrete topology.
